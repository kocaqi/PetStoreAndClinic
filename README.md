This is our Project for the CEN 302 - Software Engineering course that we have attended at Epoka University.

We have created a software for managing a Veterinarian Hospital which has different shops/locations.

The most important user is the ADMINISTRATOR, which is one and unique and has no limits in what they can do.

Then, each shop/location, has its own MANAGER, which can be only added by the ADMINISTRATOR. The MANAGER controls all the work flow and can also manage the work of their shop/location. 

Each shop/location has a group of DOCTORs, who can be added only by the shop/location MANAGER or the ADMINISTRATOR. DOCTORs can view and edit medical information of pets and have view-only access to the other information of them.

Also, each shop has a group of RECEPTIONISTs, who can be added only be the shop/location MANAGER of ADMINISTRATOR. RECEPTIONISTs can view and edit non-medical information of pets and have view-only access to the medial one. Also, RECEPTIONISTs are responsible for generating bills to clients according to what the clients have bought for their pets or to the medical services that they have received from the doctors. 

Lastly, the CLIENTs have access to their and their petsâ€™ general information. CLIENTs are added by a RECEPTIONIST, MANAGER, or the ADMINISTRATOR. However, CLIENTs are not assigned to any shop/location and can get service from anywhere they are. 

Please visit the main Wiki for more detailed information on how the software is build step by step.
